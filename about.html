It focuses on the Peaky Blinders street gang and the boss their ambitious and cunning Tommy Shelby (Murphy). The gang comes to the attention of Major Chester Campbell (Neill), a Detective Chief Inspector in the Royal Irish Constabulary sent by Winston Churchill from Belfast, where he had been sent to clear the city of the flying columns of the Irish Republican Army, the Communist Party of Great Britain, street gangs and common criminals.

                David Renshaw of The Guardian summarized the series as a "fast-paced, riveting tale of post-World War I Birmingham gangsters", praising Murphy as the "tood-so-cool Tommy Shelby" and the rest of the cast for "their strong". performances". Sarah Compton of The Telegraph gave the series a rating of 4/5, praising the show for its originality and "taking all our expectations and confounding them". Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy believes that "Peaky Blinders started as sharp as an arrow",[37] while Den of Geek called the series "the smartest, most stylish and gripping BBC drama ever". Cult TV Times critic Hugh David said the show "lives up the billing" by "managing to tick several ratings boxes for period drama, gangster epic, movie stars but goes against the grain in the most interesting ways".<br><br>
                The show has been particularly celebrated for its stylish cinematography and charismatic performances, as well as its glimpse into a part of England and English history rarely explored on television. Historians have been divided on whether bringing characters and events from other decades into a 1920s story undermines claims of historical accuracy, or whether working-class life in the period is still depicted in a truthful and resonant way. Reviews for the second series remained positive, with Ellen E. Jones of The Independent commenting that "Peaky Blinders now boasts some big-name actors to complement the excellent work of Cillian Murphy, Helen McCrory and Sam Neill", referencing- it's the second series. series additions Tom Hardy and Noah Taylor.<br><br>
                Several critics have favorably compared the show to the American series Boardwalk Empire, which shares the same themes and historical context. The show's writer Steven Knight stated in an early interview, "You know, and I'm not just saying this, but I've never watched them. I've never seen The Wire, I've never seen Boardwalk Empire, I've never seen any of them." When asked if he deliberately avoided watching these dramas, he replied, "It's kind of deliberate in that I don't really want to look at other people's work because it inevitably affects what you do." On March 2, 2016. , Knight told Crime Scene Quarterly “I have received unsolicited communications from Michael Mann, the film director, from Dennis Lehane, Snoop Dogg he is a fan. And the late David Bowie was a big fan, more to come." (heavily hinting at Bowie's involvement in series 3). It was later confirmed that David Bowie's music would be featured, and Leonard Cohen also wrote a new song for series 3.<br><br>
                The sixth and final series received universal acclaim. On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 86 out of 100 based on 7 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim". On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a 100% approval rating based on 14 reviews, with an average critic rating of 8/10. The website's critical consensus reads: "Peaky Blinders' sixth season gracefully addresses the untimely demise of star Helen McCrory while setting the stage for a fitting climax to this epic saga of likeable scalawags."
